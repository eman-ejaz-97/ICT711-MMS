**Search Strategy Implementation:**
```java
// Flexible search strategy selection based on data state and performance requirements
public class SearchingAlgorithms {
    // Strategy 1: Linear Search - O(n) complexity, works with unsorted data
    public static Member linearSearchById(List<Member> members, String memberId) {
        System.out.println("Using Linear Search Strategy - Best for small datasets");
        for (int i = 0; i < members.size(); i++) {
            if (members.get(i).getMemberId().equals(memberId)) {
                System.out.println("Linear Search: Found at position " + i);
                return members.get(i);
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    // Strategy 2: Binary Search - O(log n) complexity, requires sorted data
    public static Member binarySearchById(List<Member> sortedMembers, String memberId) {
        System.out.println("Using Binary Search Strategy - Optimal for large sorted datasets");
        int left = 0, right = sortedMembers.size() - 1;
        int comparisons = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            comparisons++;
            int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;
            // Implementation details with performance tracking...
        }
        System.out.println("Binary Search completed in " + comparisons + " comparisons");
        return null;
    }

    // Strategy 3: Hash Search - O(1) average complexity, optimal for frequent lookups
    public static Member hashSearchById(List<Member> members, String memberId) {
        System.out.println("Using Hash Search Strategy - Optimal for frequent access");
        Map<String, Member> memberMap = new HashMap<>();
        // Build hash table for O(1) access
        for (Member member : members) {
            memberMap.put(member.getMemberId(), member);
        }
        return memberMap.get(memberId);
    }
}
```

**Sorting Strategy Framework:**
```java
// Comprehensive sorting strategy implementation
public class SortingAlgorithms {
    // Multiple sorting strategies with performance characteristics
    public static void bubbleSort(List<Member> members) {
        // O(n²) implementation with early termination optimization
    }

    public static void mergeSort(List<Member> members) {
        // O(n log n) divide-and-conquer implementation
    }

    public static void quickSort(List<Member> members) {

    protected String firstName;
    protected String lastName;
    protected String email;
    protected String phone;
    protected int performanceRating;
    protected boolean goalAchieved;
    protected double baseFee;

    // Template method defining common algorithm structure
    public final String generatePerformanceReport() {
        StringBuilder report = new StringBuilder();
        report.append("Performance Report for ").append(getFullName()).append("\n");
        report.append("Member Type: ").append(getMemberType()).append("\n");
        report.append("Performance Rating: ").append(performanceRating).append("/10\n");
        report.append("Goal Achieved: ").append(goalAchieved ? "Yes" : "No").append("\n");
        report.append("Monthly Fee: $").append(String.format("%.2f", calculateMonthlyFee())).append("\n");
        report.append(getTypeSpecificDetails()); // Hook method for subclass customization
        return report.toString();
    }

    // Abstract methods requiring subclass implementation
    public abstract double calculateMonthlyFee();
    public abstract String getMemberType();
    protected abstract String getTypeSpecificDetails();

    // Common methods available to all subclasses
    public String getFullName() {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;

        double fee = getBaseFee() * Constants.PREMIUM_MULTIPLIER;
        if (isGoalAchieved()) {
            fee *= (1 - Constants.PREMIUM_GOAL_ACHIEVEMENT_DISCOUNT);
        }
        if (isHighPerformer()) {
            fee += Constants.PREMIUM_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_BONUS;
        }

        // Input validation and sanitization
        if (memberType == null || memberData == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Member type and data cannot be null");
        }

        // Validate required fields
        validateCommonFields(memberData);

        switch (memberType.trim().toLowerCase()) {
            case "regular":
                return createRegularMember(memberData);
            case "premium":
                return createPremiumMember(memberData);
            case "student":
                return createStudentMember(memberData);
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported member type: " + memberType);
        }
    }

    private static RegularMember createRegularMember(String[] data) {

            data[4]  // phone
        );
    }

    private static PremiumMember createPremiumMember(String[] data) {
        validatePremiumSpecificFields(data);
        return new PremiumMember(
            data[0], data[1], data[2], data[3], data[4], // common fields
            data[5], // trainerName

        );
    }

        }
        // Additional validation logic...
    }
}
```

## 4. Advanced Sorting & Searching Algorithm Implementation

The Member Management System incorporates a comprehensive suite of sorting and searching algorithms, demonstrating practical application of algorithmic concepts while providing educational insights into complexity analysis and performance optimization. This implementation serves both functional requirements for efficient data management and educational objectives for understanding algorithm selection criteria and performance trade-offs.

### 4.1 Comprehensive Searching Algorithm Implementation

The system implements three distinct searching strategies, each optimized for different use cases and data characteristics, providing practical experience with algorithm trade-offs and performance considerations in real-world applications.

#### 4.1.1 Linear Search Algorithm - Comprehensive Implementation

**Algorithm Classification**: Sequential search algorithm for unsorted data collections
**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Linear relationship between input size and execution time
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant additional memory usage
**Best Case**: O(1) - Target found at first position
**Worst Case**: O(n) - Target found at last position or not found

**Strategic Use Cases and Justification**:
- **Small Datasets**: Optimal for datasets with fewer than 50 elements where algorithm overhead outweighs benefits
- **Unsorted Data**: Only viable option when data cannot be pre-sorted due to frequent insertions
- **Simplicity Requirements**: Preferred when implementation simplicity is prioritized over performance
- **Memory Constraints**: Ideal for memory-limited environments where additional data structures are prohibitive

**Enhanced Implementation with Performance Tracking**:
```java
public static Member linearSearchById(List<Member> members, String memberId) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Linear Search Execution ===");
    System.out.println("Target ID: " + memberId);
    System.out.println("Dataset size: " + members.size());

    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
    int comparisons = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < members.size(); i++) {
        comparisons++;
        System.out.println("Comparison " + comparisons + ": Checking position " + i +
                          " (ID: " + members.get(i).getMemberId() + ")");

        if (members.get(i).getMemberId().equals(memberId)) {
            long endTime = System.nanoTime();
            System.out.println("✓ FOUND at position " + i + " after " + comparisons + " comparisons");
            System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " nanoseconds");
            System.out.println("Efficiency: " + ((double)(i+1)/members.size()*100) + "% of dataset searched");
            return members.get(i);
        }
    }

    long endTime = System.nanoTime();
    System.out.println("✗ NOT FOUND after " + comparisons + " comparisons");
    System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " nanoseconds");
    System.out.println("Complete dataset traversed (100%)");
    return null;
}
```

**Detailed Performance Analysis**: For the test dataset (9 members), linear search required 1-9 comparisons depending on target position, with average case performance of 4.5 comparisons for random access patterns (n/2). Performance scales linearly with dataset size, making it suitable for small datasets but inefficient for large collections.

#### 4.1.2 Binary Search Algorithm - Advanced Divide-and-Conquer Implementation

**Algorithm Classification**: Divide-and-conquer search algorithm for sorted data collections
**Time Complexity**: O(log n) - Logarithmic relationship providing exceptional scalability
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Iterative implementation with constant memory usage
**Best Case**: O(1) - Target found at middle position on first comparison
**Worst Case**: O(log n) - Maximum log₂(n) comparisons required

**Strategic Use Cases and Performance Advantages**:
- **Large Sorted Datasets**: Optimal for datasets exceeding 100 elements where logarithmic performance provides significant advantages
- **Frequent Search Operations**: Ideal when search frequency justifies initial sorting overhead
- **Scalability Requirements**: Essential for applications requiring consistent performance as data grows
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: Preferred when response time is critical business requirement

**Comprehensive Implementation with Educational Insights**:
```java
public static Member binarySearchById(List<Member> sortedMembers, String memberId) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Binary Search Execution ===");
    System.out.println("Target ID: " + memberId);
    System.out.println("Sorted dataset size: " + sortedMembers.size());
    System.out.println("Theoretical maximum comparisons: " +
                      (int)Math.ceil(Math.log(sortedMembers.size()) / Math.log(2)));

    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
    int left = 0, right = sortedMembers.size() - 1;
    int comparisons = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        comparisons++;
        int middle = left + (right - left) / 2; // Overflow-safe middle calculation
        Member middleMember = sortedMembers.get(middle);

        System.out.println("Comparison " + comparisons + ":");
        System.out.println("  Search range: [" + left + ", " + right + "] (size: " + (right - left + 1) + ")");
        System.out.println("  Middle position: " + middle + " (ID: " + middleMember.getMemberId() + ")");

        int comparison = middleMember.getMemberId().compareTo(memberId);

        if (comparison == 0) {
            long endTime = System.nanoTime();
            System.out.println("  ✓ EXACT MATCH FOUND!");
            System.out.println("Result: Found at index " + middle + " after " + comparisons + " comparisons");
            System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " nanoseconds");
            System.out.println("Efficiency: " + comparisons + "/" +
                              (int)Math.ceil(Math.log(sortedMembers.size()) / Math.log(2)) +
                              " comparisons used");
            return middleMember;
        } else if (comparison < 0) {
            System.out.println("  → Target is GREATER, searching right half");
            left = middle + 1;
        } else {
            System.out.println("  → Target is SMALLER, searching left half");
            right = middle - 1;
        }
    }

    long endTime = System.nanoTime();
    System.out.println("✗ NOT FOUND after " + comparisons + " comparisons");
    System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " nanoseconds");
    return null;
}
```

**Advanced Performance Analysis**: Maximum 4 comparisons required for 9-member dataset (⌈log₂(9)⌉ = 4). For 1000-member dataset, requires maximum 10 comparisons vs. 1000 for linear search, demonstrating approximately 50% search space elimination per comparison.

#### 4.1.3 Hash-Based Search Algorithm - Optimal Performance Implementation

**Algorithm Classification**: Hash table-based direct access search algorithm
**Time Complexity**: O(1) average case - Constant time performance independent of dataset size
**Worst Case Complexity**: O(n) - Hash collision degradation to linear search
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Additional memory proportional to dataset size
**Load Factor Optimization**: Maintained below 0.75 for optimal performance

**Strategic Use Cases and Performance Optimization**:
- **High-Frequency Search Operations**: Optimal when search operations significantly outnumber modifications
- **Large Dataset Applications**: Essential for datasets exceeding 1000 elements with frequent access requirements
- **Memory-Abundant Environments**: Preferred when memory usage is less constrained than performance requirements
- **Real-Time Applications**: Critical for applications requiring guaranteed response times

**Advanced Implementation with Performance Monitoring**:
```java
public static Member hashSearchById(List<Member> members, String memberId) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Hash Search Execution ===");
    System.out.println("Target ID: " + memberId);
    System.out.println("Dataset size: " + members.size());

    long buildStartTime = System.nanoTime();

    // Build optimized hash table with capacity planning
    int initialCapacity = (int)(members.size() / 0.75) + 1; // Optimal load factor
    Map<String, Member> memberHashMap = new HashMap<>(initialCapacity);

    System.out.println("Building hash table with initial capacity: " + initialCapacity);

    for (Member member : members) {
        memberHashMap.put(member.getMemberId(), member);
    }

    long buildEndTime = System.nanoTime();
    System.out.println("Hash table construction time: " + (buildEndTime - buildStartTime) + " nanoseconds");
    System.out.println("Final hash table size: " + memberHashMap.size());
    System.out.println("Load factor: " + String.format("%.3f", (double)memberHashMap.size() / initialCapacity));

    // Perform O(1) lookup
    long searchStartTime = System.nanoTime();
    Member result = memberHashMap.get(memberId);
    long searchEndTime = System.nanoTime();

    System.out.println("Hash lookup time: " + (searchEndTime - searchStartTime) + " nanoseconds");
    System.out.println("Total operation time: " + (searchEndTime - buildStartTime) + " nanoseconds");

    if (result != null) {
        System.out.println("✓ FOUND via direct hash access");
        System.out.println("Hash efficiency: O(1) constant time lookup achieved");
    } else {
        System.out.println("✗ NOT FOUND - ID not in hash table");
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Comprehensive Performance Analysis**: O(1) lookup performance independent of dataset size with additional O(n) space requirement. Typically beneficial when more than 5-10 search operations performed per dataset, with amortized performance benefits over multiple operations.

**Small Datasets (n < 50)**:
- Any algorithm performs adequately
- Choose based on implementation simplicity
- Insertion sort excellent for nearly-sorted data

**Medium Datasets (50 ≤ n < 1000)**:
- Avoid O(n²) sorting algorithms
- Binary search becomes significantly beneficial
- Quick sort or merge sort recommended

**Large Datasets (n ≥ 1000)**:
- Hash-based search essential for frequent lookups
- O(n²) algorithms become prohibitively slow
- Consider database solutions for very large datasets

### 5.4 Space-Time Tradeoffs

#### Memory vs. Speed Analysis:

**Search Algorithms**:
- Linear/Binary: Minimal memory, suitable for memory-constrained environments
- Hash: Higher memory usage but superior performance for frequent operations

**Sort Algorithms**:
- In-place (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Heap): Minimal additional memory
- Merge Sort: Requires additional O(n) space but guaranteed stable performance
- Quick Sort: Best practical performance with minimal average space usage

### 8.2 Key Implementation Features

#### 8.2.1 Object-Oriented Design Principles

**Inheritance and Polymorphism**:
```java
// Abstract base class with polymorphic methods
public abstract class Member {
    public abstract double calculateMonthlyFee();
    public abstract String getMemberType();
}

// Subclass implementation with specific behavior
public class RegularMember extends Member {
    @Override
    public double calculateMonthlyFee() {
        double fee = getBaseFee();
        if (isGoalAchieved()) {
            fee *= (1 - Constants.REGULAR_GOAL_ACHIEVEMENT_DISCOUNT);
        }
        return fee;
    }
}
```

**Encapsulation and Data Protection**:
```java
public class Member {
    private String memberId;
    private int performanceRating;
    
    public void setPerformanceRating(int rating) {
        if (rating >= Constants.MIN_PERFORMANCE_RATING && 
            rating <= Constants.MAX_PERFORMANCE_RATING) {
            this.performanceRating = rating;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 8.2.2 Algorithm Implementation Examples

**Binary Search Implementation**:
```java
public static Member binarySearchById(List<Member> sortedMembers, String memberId) {
    int left = 0, right = sortedMembers.size() - 1;
    int comparisons = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        comparisons++;
        int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;
        Member middleMember = sortedMembers.get(middle);
        
        int comparison = middleMember.getMemberId().compareTo(memberId);
        if (comparison == 0) {
            System.out.println("Binary Search: Found member at index " + middle + 
                             " after " + comparisons + " comparisons");
            return middleMember;
        } else if (comparison < 0) {
            left = middle + 1;
        } else {
            right = middle - 1;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

**Merge Sort Implementation**:
```java
private static void merge(List<Member> list, int left, int middle, int right) {
    List<Member> leftArray = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Member> rightArray = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Copy data to temporary arrays
    for (int i = left; i <= middle; i++) {
        leftArray.add(list.get(i));
    }
    for (int j = middle + 1; j <= right; j++) {
        rightArray.add(list.get(j));
    }
    
    // Merge the temporary arrays back
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < leftArray.size() && j < rightArray.size()) {
        if (leftArray.get(i).calculateMonthlyFee() <= 
            rightArray.get(j).calculateMonthlyFee()) {
            list.set(k, leftArray.get(i));
            i++;
        } else {
            list.set(k, rightArray.get(j));
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }
